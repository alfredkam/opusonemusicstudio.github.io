Shirley Wu began her piano lessons at Wuhan Academy of Music when she was 4 years old. Every Saturday, for the next 9 years or so, her mother, a former university professor and an amateur violinist, brought Shirley to piano lessons. Shirley’s grandfather, very proficient in the Chinese traditional art Tai Chi and Chinese chess, have always taught the family the importance of arts in a person’s life. When Shirley was 13, her family immigrated to Montreal, Canada. Shirley attended F.A.C.E.
